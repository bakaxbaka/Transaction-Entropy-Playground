Upgrade and expand this interface into a fully functional crypto-analysis dashboard.
Keep the same dark-grid cyber-forensic / neon-green terminal UI theme shown in the reference image.
Preserve the layout logic, but make it more refined, modern, and feature-complete.

🧱 1. Global Styling Rules

Keep the retro-terminal aesthetic: black background, subtle grid lines, neon green UI elements.

Add optional secondary accents (cyan or amber) where needed for hierarchy.

Use a monospaced font for inputs, logs, txids, addresses (e.g., JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Inter).

Maintain glowing outlines, scanlines, and animated cursor-like indicators.

All UI panels should look like hardware modules in a forensic analysis workstation.

🧭 2. Application Structure (keep existing layout but upgrade it)

The screen must remain divided into these zones:

Left column: Target Input + System Log

Right main panel: Results, Derived Data, Tools (Key Derivation, Live Mempool, Block Scanner)

Top header: Application title, navigation tabs, status indicators

Upgrade all components to be sharper, more consistent, and functional.

🎯 3. TARGET ADDRESS MODULE (left side)

Upgrade the “Target Address” block:

Add fields:

Bitcoin Address

Scan Depth selector (e.g., latest 50 / 100 / all)

Add buttons:

[Fetch TXs]

[Export Raw Data]

Add a diagnostic line under input:

“API Status: OK / Error / Rate Limited”

Keep the illuminated “INITIATE SCAN” button but modernize the glow and border.

📟 4. SYSTEM LOG PANEL (left bottom)

Upgrade the System Log to look like a live terminal:

Auto-scroll output

Timestamp each event

Add filter tabs:

All

Warnings

API

KeyGen

Add a blinking cursor animation at bottom (“awaiting events…”)

🧩 5. MAIN PANEL — Upgrade All Functional Tabs
A. Key Derivation (default tab)

Current block should be expanded into a full workflow:

Input Section:

Display fetched TXIDs as selectable rows.

Add toggles:

“Use txid as entropy (synthetic)”

“Derive BTC formats: Legacy / P2SH-P2WPKH / Bech32”

“Derive synthetic ETH address”

Derived Data Table:

Columns:

Source TXID

Synthetic ETH Address

Synthetic BTC (Legacy)

Synthetic BTC (SegWit)

Synthetic BTC (Bech32)

Balance (BTC/ETH)

Add actions:

[Export BTC Data]

[Export ETH Data]

[Check Balances]

Hover tooltips with additional hash info.

Add subtle column glow when new data arrives.

B. Live Mempool Tab

Replace green placeholder tab with a full functional UI:

Add components:

Live mempool size graph (neon-line waveform)

Table of unconfirmed transactions:

TXID

Fee rate (sat/vB)

Total output

First seen

Filter bar:

Min fee rate slider

Search TXID box

Refresh interval selector

Add a flashing “LIVE DATA STREAM” indicator.

C. Block Scanner Tab

Upgrade this to a full block investigation interface:

Input fields:

Block height

Block hash

Buttons:

[Scan Block]

[Export Block Data]

Block summary card:

Height, Hash, Timestamp

Miner

Transaction count

Total fees

TX list panel with filters:

Incoming / Outgoing

High-fee

Coinbase only

Button:

[Send Selected TXIDs to Key Derivation]

🛰️ 6. TOP HEADER BAR UPGRADE

Keep the green indicators but redesign them to be more high-tech:

NODE: ONLINE / OFFLINE

MEMPOOL: ACTIVE / IDLE

API PING TIME: (ms)

NETWORK HEIGHT: ######

Add a small animated signal strength icon.

🧰 7. NEW FEATURE MODULES TO ADD
A. Balance Check Panel

Add a modal that displays BTC and ETH balances for all generated synthetic addresses.

Show:

Balance

First seen transaction

Last activity

B. Data Export Center

Export:

All derived BTC formats → [btc_<orig_address>.txt]

All derived ETH addresses → [eth_<orig_address>.txt]

Raw scan logs → .log

C. Settings Panel

Custom API endpoints

RPC configuration

Toggle “Always Mask Sensitive Data”

🎨 8. Visual Enhancements

Add subtle animated scanlines over panels.

Add matrix-style falling characters in the background at 10% opacity.

When hovering over TXIDs, show a neon tooltip popup with full hex and metadata.

Add a “terminal audio click” indicator icon (visual only).

📐 9. Responsiveness

Desktop-first

Collapsible left column for compact mode

Auto-flow grid for tables when screen shrinks

Goal: Produce a professional, cinematic cyber-forensic dashboard that feels like a mix of BlockSci, Chainalysis Reactor, and a hacker terminal—but polished and fully functional.

Ensure every screen feels like an advanced blockchain investigation tool, with elegant glowing neon visuals and structured layouts.
